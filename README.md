# bpf_samples

This repository has multiple types of samples:

1. Samples pulled from other projects (bpf_cilium_test, falco, ovs, etc.)
2. Samples with source in this project.  Source code is under the "src" directory, and the built ELF files appear in the "build" directory.
3. Invalid samples used for testing file parsing and verification. Such files are under the "invalid" directory.
